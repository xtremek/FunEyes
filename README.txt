FunEyes by Jesse L. Zamora

Introduction
FunEyes is a Qt4 fun faces program based on KEyes by <FIND AUTHOR NAME!!!>I rewrote it in C++ and added several new features. The motive for making this program was, well, to have fun! If you have an idea for a new feature, please email me at xtremekforever@gmail.com

Installation:
To install, simple open a terminal window (such as Gnome terminal or Konsole) and change to the directory you extracted the files:

cd /path/to/funeyes

Then run:

# qmake
# make

If you want to install the files, just run:

# make install

as the root user.

Have a load of fun!!
